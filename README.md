# Advent of Code 2019

This repository has my rust solutions for Advent of Code 2019

## Structure

Each day has its own directory.

Each directory contains:
* `#part.rs` source file for each part
* my input file (`inp.txt`)


## Compiling and Running

running `rustc #part.rs` will create an executable named `#part`
run it with the input file as stdin: `./#part < inp.txt`
